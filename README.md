BookmarkList
================

Tiny plugin to display your StatusNet Bookmarks

## Note
If you're using [Gnu Social](https://www.gnu.org/software/social/), you don't need this plugin; the functionality is built into the "Bookmarks" plugin that's included in the default install.

## Instructions

Make sure the files are in a folder called `BookmarkList` if they're not already  
Put the folder in your `/plugins/` directory  
Tell `/config.php` to use it with: `addPlugin('BookmarkList');`  
A `Bookmarks` link should appear in the left-nav of your profile page.
